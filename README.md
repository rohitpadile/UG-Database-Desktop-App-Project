I have tried to make a database without using Any Database Management System.
This is a Local Desktop Application where you have two profiles - admin and user.
user profile has 2 options - To Find a Student and To Add a Student.
Admin profile has 2 more options - To Delete a Student and To Edit a Student details.
Validations for information have been made according to the Student profile at Coep Technological University.

Eager to add more features to this application as I learn more.
